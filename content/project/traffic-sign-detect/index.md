title: "Traffic Sign Detection under Challenging Conditions"
summary: "We propose a Traffic Sign Detection & Segmentation pipeline. A faster RCNN has been used to detect traffic signs from different challenged conditions. The challenging conditions are classified using an RCNN. With the help of Kalman filter and Lukas-Kanade tracker the detection process is improved. Finally, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to classify the signs of the frames"
