I'm Suhail Najeeb. Currently working as a lecturer at the Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, East West University. I graduated in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology back in 2018. Currently I'm pursuing my MSc at the same institution as a part-time student besides my job. Although I'm a EEE graduate and also a lecturer, I have a huge interest in research projects related to Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning & Computer Vision. 2017 marked the start of this interest, when I took part in the IEEE Video & Image Processing Cup 2017 and placed 2nd runner-up in the competition for Traffic Sign Detection & Classification under Challening Conditions. In 2018, I was part of Team Markovians, who became the champions in the IEEE Video & Image Processing Cup 2018 for a lung tumor detection and segmentation pipeline. Since then, I have been involved in several research projects related to applications of Deep Learning in different Domains like Biomedical Signal Processing, Image Processing, Speech Synthesis and Genomics etc.
