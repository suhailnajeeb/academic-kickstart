abstract = "Lung cancer is the most prevalent cancer worldwide with about 230,000 new cases every year. Most cases go undiagnosed until it's too late, especially in developing countries and remote areas. Early detection is key to beating cancer. Towards this end, the work presented here proposes an automated pipeline for lung tumor detection and segmentation from 3D lung CT scans from the NSCLC-Radiomics Dataset. It also presents a new dilated hybrid-3D convolutional neural network architecture for tumor segmentation. First, a binary classifier chooses CT scan slices that may contain parts of a tumor. To segment the tumors, the selected slices are passed to the segmentation model which extracts feature maps from each 2D slice using dilated convolutions and then fuses the stacked maps through 3D convolutions - incorporating the 3D structural information present in the CT scan volume into the output. Lastly, the segmentation masks are passed through a post-processing block which cleans them up through morphological operations. The proposed segmentation model outperformed other contemporary models like LungNet and U-Net. The average and median dice coefficient on the test set for the proposed model were 65.7% and 70.39% respectively. The next best model, LungNet had dice scores of 62.67% and 66.78%."
